But if you plan ahead, you can keep the waiting to a minimum.\nPart of that planning is going at the right time. Visitors are somewhat predictable: they don’t visit uniformly throughout the year. If you have the flexibility, you can minimize your wait times by going when other people aren’t. But when are those times?\nTo try to answer that question, I found a great dataset from Touring Plans of posted wait times for several attractions in each park every few minutes of each day going back to 2015."

    "text": "A year at Magic Kingdom in waits\nFor Magic Kingdom, Touring Plans has data for three attractions: Pirates of the Caribbean, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Splash Mountain. To get a sense of how waits at Magic Kingdom vary over the calender year, I took waits from every day between January 1st, 2015 and March 15, 2020 (the last day Disney World was open before it shut down for Covid), dropped the year (combining, for example, all waits from January 1st from all years), then computed the mean waits for each day of the year based on the three attractions.\nHere are the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot also shows US holidays (some holidays fell on different days between 2015 and 2021), and estimates of public school breaks. School breaks vary a lot, so I just went with the dates of the Orange County Public School district in Florida, which includes Orlando. The data on US holidays comes from here.\nThere are a few conclusions that you can draw from this plot:\n\nWaits spike during holidays.\nWaits rise in the summer.\nWaits rise in late March/early April, probably due to Spring break.\nWaits seem to be lowest in the Fall and early December.\nOn any given day, waits vary a lot. The gray bands show the boundaries between the 25th and 75th percentiles for waits each day for the five years in the data. For example, the mean wait on January 1st is 52 minutes, but 25% of the posted waits on that day for the three attractions were under 20 minutes and 25% of the posted waits were over 75 minutes.\nNew Year’s Eve is hell at Magic Kingdom.\n\nThis plot is already pretty helpful, but it would be nice if we would be a little more precise. That is, can we use a statistical model to say, in quantitative terms, how much better or worse the best and worst times to visit are?"

    "text": "How much of a difference does the time of year make?\nI fit a linear regression model that used week of the year and whether the day was within a day of a holiday to predict wait times. (Including whether a day was during a school break didn’t make much difference in terms of predictions, probably because week of the year already captured most of what “break time” would.)\n\nResults\nOn average, days that are on or near holidays have average waits that are about 6 minutes longer than days that aren’t.\nThe effects of week are shown below. Because the actual wait times are somewhat meaningless (they are just averages of three attractions), I’ve plotted changes in terms of percent. These changes are relative to Week 16 of the year (around mid-April), which is pretty close to an average week at Disney World.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best weeks to visit in terms of low waits are:\n\nSeptember through early October, when waits can decrease by 20-30% from baseline.\nfirst half of December, when waits can decrease by about 20% from baseline.\n\nThe worst weeks to visit are:\n\nThe last two weeks of the year and the first week of the year, when waits can increase by over 20% from baseline.\nLate March to early April, when waits can increase by about 20% from baseline.\nMid-July to early August, when waits can increase by 15-20% from baseline.\n\nAnd don’t ever go to Disney World on New Years Eve."

    "text": "How has Covid affected waits?\nDisney World shut down due to Covid on March 15th, 2020. It reopened on July 11th that same year and has remained open ever since. It changed a lot of its operations after reopening. And, initially, visitors were skittish about returning. So how have wait times changed since reopening?\nTo answer this question, I compared the model’s predicted wait times to the posted wait times from the Touring Plans dataset, collected from the date of reopening.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there’s a lot of missing data in the Fall of 2020.\nThis plot suggests that, since reopening, wait times have generally been a little lower than average, except for maybe in July 2021. However, it looks like waits are beginning to return to their usual patterns as of this past Fall. It’s probably too soon to say whether it’s a persisent pattern.\nFor comparison, we can do the same analysis for a different park. I fit another model using the same method with Touring Plans data for the Hollywood Studios park in Disney World. Touring Plans provides wait times for four attractions in Hollywood Studios: Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster, Alien Swirling Saucers, Slinky Dog Dash, and Toy Story Mania.\nHere’s the comparable plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern is basically the same. Generally lower-than-expected waits and an apparent return to normal starting this past Fall."

    "text": "Should I book my trip?\nNot quite yet.\nAs a check, I compared my work to the weekly ranking developed by Dave Shute of yourfirstvisit.net. Dave doesn’t base his recommendations on statistics and data analysis. Instead, they’re based on his years of firsthand knowledge and experience. Here are his recommendations for 2021.\n Surprisingly, his recommendations don’t align with mine much at all. Some of his top-ranked weeks are in the middle of summer. After that, he recommends going in mid-April and early May.\n\nWhat’s going on?\nFirst, Dave factors in more than crowd levels. He considers things like weather and ride closures. September may be a low-crowd time but it’s also peak hurricane season. And low-crowd times tend to coincide with suboptimal experiences: Disney is well aware of these seasonal patterns, so they reduce operating hours and schedule attraction refurbishments in the off-season. This means you may get less time in the park and fewer things to do if you go during a less popular time.\nSo if your goal is to have the best overall experience (which Dave’s advice is targeted toward), choosing the the lowest-crowd time may not actually be best.\nSecond, Dave may have some knowledge not captured in the data. He seems to discount some of the weeks (like in early December) as heavy-crowd times that my analysis predicts will have lower than average waits.\n\n\nOkay, but all I care about is short waits. Should I book my trip now?\nAll else being equal, lower waits are better. But is this data giving an accurate picture of wait times? Maybe not.\nAside from the fact that the dataset only includes a few attractions per park, the data are posted wait times, not actual wait times. Disney is notorious for inflating posted wait times. After all, people are happier when they get in a line expecting to wait 30 minutes and only end up waiting 15 than when they get in a line expecting to wait 15 and end up waiting 30.\nAdditionally, ever since Disney parks started posting wait times on their mobile apps, it’s been strongly suspected that they intentionally manipulate posted wait times to disperse crowds. For example, they might inflate wait times in Tomorrowland to push people toward Frontierland on the other side of the park. (To learn more about this, along with the fascinating history of FastPasses and their influence on wait times, check out this nearly two-hour long video. It’s really interesting, I promise!)\nSo you probably shouldn’t take the absolute numbers too seriously. But if waits are consistently inflated year-round, you can probably expect to encounter shorter waits in September than in June, for example, and you can treat this data as an indirect measure of crowds levels."

This is due to the overly simple department-location matching procedure I used.\nOne example is the Miami-Dade Police Department. This got included because it has the phrase Police Department in it. However, Miami-Dade is a county (a large one, with about 2.5 million people living there) and is identified as Miami-Dade County in my county population dataset. So the department name and county name fail to match because the word “county” doesn’t appear in the name of the department.\nThis actually happened a lot, so you can’t really trust all the zeros. But surely some of the zeros are accurate. For example, this site reports that 16 out of Indiana’s 92 counties have had no “line of duty” deaths. To not include departments with no deaths would be a mistake. But given the dataset I had, there wasn’t a reliable way to identify those departments, and I knew for a fact that many of the zeros I found were simply due to name mismatches. So I decided it was best overall to just remove the zeros entirely.\nHere’s the same plot with the zeros removed.\n\npopVsDeaths2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels2, population &lt;= 75000),\n             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType),\n             color = \"turquoise3\", alpha = 1/3, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels2, population &gt; 75000),\n             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType),\n             color = \"darkslategrey\", alpha = 1/3) +\n  geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2,\n             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType),\n             color = \"orangered1\",\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2,\n                  mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, label = locationLabel),\n                  size = 3,\n                  max.overlaps = Inf) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\"1,000\", \"10,000\", \"100,000\", \"1,000,000\", \"10,000,000\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Population\",\n       y = \"Deaths\",\n       shape = \"Location\",\n       title = str_c(\"Officer Deaths, \", startingYear, \"-\", finalYear),\n       subtitle = \"Locations where at least one death occurred\") +\n  guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = \"black\")))\nprint(popVsDeaths2)\n\n\n\n\nMany fewer departments (especially from small cities), but same basic shape.

I assume department size is correlated with population anyway.\nAlso, from this point on, I’m going to continue to exclude the zero-death locations for the reasons explained above.\n\nscaledPopsVsDeaths &lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsNoZeros) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),\n             shape = \"circle open\",\n             alpha = 1/3) +\n  geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2,\n             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),\n             shape = \"circle\",\n             color = \"coral3\",\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2,\n                  mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths,\n                                label = locationLabel),\n                  size = 3,\n                  max.overlaps = Inf) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\"1,000\", \"10,000\", \"100,000\", \"1,000,000\", \"10,000,000\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Population\",\n       y = \"Deaths per 10K\",\n       size = \"Total deaths\",\n       title = \"Officer deaths per 10,000 in the department's jurisdiction\",\n       subtitle = str_c(\"Cumulative deaths, \", startingYear, \"-\", finalYear)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  \nprint(scaledPopsVsDeaths)\n\n\n\n\nThis plot suggests that Terre Haute is above average but maybe not a huge outlier, even among cities of similar population size.\nMore generally, this plot suggests there is not much of a relationship between city size and number of officer deaths, at least for cities above a certain size. The reason it looks like there is a relationship between population and deaths is almost certainly due to there being greater variability for smaller towns/departments. For example, a single death in a small town would have a big effect on this metric.\nSo let’s exclude small towns (population &lt; 50,000) to get a better understanding.\n\nscaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns &lt;- ggplot(data = deathCounts_noSmallTowns) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),\n             shape = \"circle open\",\n             alpha = 1/3) +\n  geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights_noSmallTowns,\n             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),\n             shape = \"circle\",\n             color = \"coral3\",\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels_noSmallTowns,\n                  mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths,\n                                label = locationLabel),\n                  size = 3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4,5,6,7),\n                     labels = c(\"10,000\", \"100,000\", \"1,000,000\", \"10,000,000\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Population\",\n       y = \"Deaths per 10K\",\n       size = \"Total deaths\",\n       title = \"Officer deaths per 10,000 people in the department's jurisdiction\",\n       subtitle = str_c(\"Cumulative deaths, \", startingYear, \"-\", finalYear)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  \nprint(scaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns)\n\n\n\n\nThis plot allows us to get a better sense of variability, especially among midsize towns. In this plot, Terre Haute does look a bit more like an outlier. In more quantitative terms, among the locations in the plot above, Terre Haute is in the 99th percentile for officer deaths, scaled by population size. It drops to the 93rd percentile if you include the small towns that were in the previous plot."

    "text": "Image credit: Marcelo Leal on Unsplash.\nOne of the many frustrating things about health care in the US is not having a clue what things are going to cost. But this year, a new federal law went into effect requiring hospitals to publish all of their prices.\nI learned about this after reading this article in the New York Times by Sarah Kliff and Josh Katz. They analyzed the price lists at a number of hospitals and found some huge disparities in prices for identical treatments at the same hospitals and some puzzling discrepancies in insurers’ negotiated prices. Notably, sometimes, the listed price for a treatment negotiated by an insurance company was higher than the listed price for a patient with no insurance at all. For insurance plans with high deductibles, this means you could potentially save money by not using your insurance for some treatments.\nThis got me curious about my own insurance and my own local hospital, so I decided to do a similar analysis."

So I personally wouldn’t consider it a guarantee that because an entry in this list shows that a specific procedure is cheaper with no insurance that I’d be better off not using my insurance to get it.\nBut this information isn’t made up either. Hospitals do use these price lists as a starting point (at least) for billing. So I think it’s reasonable to use these price lists to draw some broadly valid conclusions about the value of your health insurance and the approximate costs of your health care."

The difference between a price tag of $50,000 and $60,000 may be irrelevant to you if you have health insurance with a deductible of $2,000 that pays all costs after that deductible is met. So some of these price discrepancies are problems for insurance companies, not for consumers.\nBut, as you’ll note above, some of the cases where Anthem is beat by the “no insurance” rates are well below common deductibles.

Personally, I loved teaching psychology through the lens of everyday applications.\nI gave students a survey at the end of the quarter with a single question: What was the most important or useful thing you learned in this course? Here are a few of the most thoughtful responses:\n\nThe most important thing I learned in this course was the differences between the various ways to use social media. Normally, when social media comes up in a class, it is entirely bashing it. In this class however, we looked at how to use social media in a way that makes it beneficial, as well as how it can be dangerous only when used under certain conditions.\n\n\nI appreciated the deep and broad discussion on IQ. Intelligence is often both a weighty and a non-agreed-upon idea, so being able to hear a breadth of opinions in one place as well as a clear definition of what psychologists mean when they say IQ was helpful for me to gather my own thoughts on the topic.\n\n\nAlthough it was not one of the weekly subjects, one of the most useful things I can take away from this course is the confidence to read and understand academic papers. I feel less intimidated by the long length and dry language and more confident in my ability to understand the paper and notice its strengths and flaws. And I am more likely to read a study after seeing an article about it outside of class.\n\n\nI think the coolest and most interesting stuff we talked about was the prejudice topic week. Looking at that topic that you hear a lot about in the news from a psychological side was interesting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Amy Schneider on Jeopardy.\nThree of the top five longest winning streaks in Jeopardy history have happened during the show’s current 38th season. This has led some to wonder whether there has been some kind of paradigm shift in how Jeopardy is played.\nIt’s possible the answer is yes, but it would be a little surprising for it to happen so suddenly. If something about the game or how people play it were changing, it’s more likely that you’d find changing trends over time.\nI collected Jeopardy win data from every episode from J! Archive, an unofficial database of questions and outcomes from the show, to see if I could find any trends.\n(Collecting and organizing this data turned out to be trickier than I expected. I’ll say a bit more about that later, but you can skip ahead if you’re interested.)\nI’ll get right to the point. Is there any evidence of more streaks over time? Not really.\nFirst, let’s look at the streaks.\nThis plot starts with Season 20, after a five-win limit was eliminated (shortly after, Ken Jennings began his record-setting run). I’ve highlighted the top five longest streaks. It’s easy to see why the latest cluster at the far right might raise some eyebrows. But is it the tail end of a trend?\nLet’s look at the number of “long” win streaks over time. I defined a long streak as at least five consecutive wins (the limit when the show began).\nFrom the plot, it looks like maybe there has been a slight increase in long streaks in the past ~15 seasons, but it’s hard to argue there is a recent uptick (barring Season 38).\nWhat about streak length? The plot below shows the distribution of streak lengths for each season.\nThis plot can be a little confusing at first. Each bar includes most of the win streaks for a season. The darkest shade includes 50% of the win streaks, the medium shade includes 80% of the win streaks, and the lightest shade includes 95% of the win streaks.\nThis plot clearly shows that the most recent season is an extreme outlier. Excluding Season 38, it’s hard to see a clear increasing trend in average streak length, aside from the fact that win streaks got a little longer after the win limit was eliminated.\nJames Holzhauer, one of the show’s record-holders, doesn’t think the recent run of streaks is meaningful: “People always assume everything is a paradigm shift … when it’s actually fairly normal for results to occasionally cluster.” I think the data support his interpretation."

I ran into a few difficulties with the way the data was formatted in J! Archive. I’ll share a couple of them partly for interest and partly so that if anyone decides to use my data, they will understand it may contain some errors.\n\nContestant names\nEach game page includes full contestant names at the top of the page and “nicknames” (usually first names – the names that show up on people’s screens on Jeopardy) at the bottom of the page with the final scores.\nThis created a challenge because while there is almost certainly only one “James Holzhauer” to compete on Jeopardy, there’s definitely not one “James” to ever compete on Jeopardy.\nTo figure out streaks, it was helpful to first assign a unique identifier to each contestant, like their full name. Then I could figure out which James won or lost each game.\nIn most cases, I could just compare the “nicknames” to the full names and look for a match. But some people named James go by Jim, for example, and in those cases, a direct match won’t work. So I had to manually add a bunch of special cases shown below.\n\nfind_full_contestant_name &lt;- function(contestant_list, nickname) {\n  # Remove all non-alpha characters \n  #(except for hyphen, period, apostrophe, and internal spaces)\n  n &lt;- str_remove_all(nickname, \"[^a-zA-Z\\\\-.' ]\")\n  n &lt;- str_trim(n)\n  \n  # I've hard-coded some nicknames here to take care of hard cases in the data\n  if (n == \"Mike\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Mike|Michael)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Dave\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Dave|David)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Tom\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Tom|Thomas)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Dottie\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Dottie|Dorothy)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Ernie\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Ernie|Ernest)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Charlie\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Charlie|Charles)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Ray\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Ray|Arthur)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Sandy\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Sandy|Sandra)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"SSGT Paul\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Paul Croshier\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"DJ\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(DJ|David)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Sparky\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Sparky|John)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Air Rob\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Air Rob|Rob)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"BobCat\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(BobCat|Bob)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"MaryBeth\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(MaryBeth|Mary Beth)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"zgn\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Ozgun\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Julin\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Julián\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Franois\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Francois\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Rene\" || n == \"Renée\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Rene|Renée)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Rb\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Røb\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Dr. Oz\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Dr. Mehmet Oz\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Desire\") {\n    n &lt;- \"(Desirée|Desire)\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Frdrique\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Frédérique\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Genevive\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Geneviève\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Nio\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Niño\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Steve-O\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Steven\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Csar\") {\n    n &lt;- \"César\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Sebastin\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Sebastián\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Nadge\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Nadège\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Andrs\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Andrés\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Ramn\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Ramón\"\n  }\n  else if (n == \"Anglica\") {\n    n &lt;- \"Angélica\"\n  }\n\n  \n  # Cycle through all names in contestant list and look for a match\n  for (c in contestant_list) {\n    if (!is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(c), str_to_lower(n))[1])) {\n      return(c)\n    }\n  }\n  \n  # No matches found\n  print(paste(contestant_list[1],\n              contestant_list[2],\n              contestant_list[3], n,sep = \",\"))\n  stop(\"Error: find_full_contestant_name found no name matches.\")\n}\n\nA number of the special cases were to match names that contained characters that I had stripped away at the beginning (which I did because I found a contestant whose nickname was in the archive as “Jen :)”)\n\n\nInterrupted streaks\nJeopardy occasionally runs special events like tournaments or college championships that are scheduled in advance and interrupt regular play. When identifying streaks, I had to skip past these events somehow.\nLuckily, J! Archive includes a “comments” field at the top of every page with notes about each episode like whether it was a tournament. So again, I used a brute-force approach, matching the contents of the comments field to a list in order to filter out all these special events.\nThe difficulty, yet again, was figuring out how many different special events there were (I’m still not sure I caught them all). Here’s the snippet of code where I tried to exclude tournaments, championships, kids weeks, celebrity Jeopardy, and more.\n\nstreaks_by_season &lt;- j_data |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"tournament\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"championship\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"battle\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"all-star\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"celebrity\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"kids\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(str_match(str_to_lower(comments), \"week\"))) |&gt;"

Instead, subreddit communities coordinated and cooperated to produce something pretty amazing (see the final product at the top of this post).\nAfter r/place ended, Reddit released all the pixel data from the event. I thought it might be interesting to see what I could learn from it."

    "text": "How did the event unfold?\nOne of the most fascinating parts of watching r/place happen was all the ensuing drama – the feuds, the conflicts, the warring factions, the invasions. Groups were constantly battling over territory, there was a purely destructive group known as The Black Void whose goal was just to erase everything with black pixels, and certain areas were frequent targets for vandalism.\nYou can get a sense of all that by watching this timelapse video.\nWhat did the event look like from the standpoint of the raw data? First, let’s look at pixel placement activity over time.\n\nOverall activity over time 📈\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most obvious trend is increasing activity over time. Interest likely went up as more people learned about r/place.\nThe plot also shows moderator activity (the colored bands). This was a point of controversy and speculation – specifically, that admins were censoring stuff they didn’t like. But according to the data, the moderators took a pretty hands-off approach, only intervening 19 times.\nWhen they did intervene, they drew a colored square over some objectionable content. The bands in the plot show the colors the mods used; the widths of the bands are relative to the size of the squares the mods drew.\n\n\nWhich colors were most popular? 🎨\nAt two points in the event, the admins increased the number of available pixel colors. By the end, there were 32 colors to pick from.\nLet’s look at which colors were most popular and when.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack and white were far and away the most popular colors.\nYou can see the two points when the new sets of colors were introduced. Most of the new colors never overtook the original colors in popularity, but a couple did.\nKeep in mind that these totals don’t necessarily represent how prevalent a color is in the final canvas. This plot just shows how often people placed pixels with each color. That color may have been overwritten numerous times.\n\n\nWhich parts of the canvas were most contentious? 🥊\nWe can get the best visual sense of the drama that unfolded on r/place by looking at which pixels had the most activity. If a pixel was overwritten many times, that’s a sign that users were fighting over that area of the canvas.\nIn the picture below, I’ve made a heatmap where brighter spots indicate areas where there was more activity and darker spots indicate areas with less activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amazing thing about this image is that, if you look carefully, you can make out many parts of the final canvas, like the Turkish flag or the osu! logo. This shows how contentious these areas were: they were frequently under attack and lots of work was put into preserving them.\nThe most active pixel was changed nearly 100,000 times. It happened to be the most upper-left pixel in the canvas. On the other end of the spectrum, there were nearly 2900 pixels (0.07% of the canvas) that were placed only once for the entire duration of the event. No pixels were completely untouched."

    "text": "Individual user activity 💻\nOne specific question I had was whether most activity was driven by a small fraction of users. This is a common phenomenon online where, for example, a small percentage of users are responsible for the vast majority of comments. This is actually a broader phenomenon known as Zipf’s law in which, essentially, the most common items in a set are vastly more common than the the less common items. Was that true here? For example, I found that over 2.3 million users in this dataset only placed a single pixel.\nI pulled the top 100,000 most prolific users (i.e., users that placed the most pixels) and plotted the number of pixels they placed in order of their their rank.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results don’t quite follow Zipf’s law. It turns out the most extremely prolific users (who placed 600+ pixels) weren’t that much more prolific than thousands of others who placed 200+ pixels.\nLet’s instead look at what they actually did, starting with the most prolific user, who placed 795 pixels. Below, I’ve traced this user’s path over roughly 3.5 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this user’s most frequent contributions, and after doing a bit of research on the r/place atlas I inferred that they are a My Little Pony fan. The My Little Pony community apparently started working in the upper left part of the canvas but moved to the upper right and later to the bottom, due to conflict with followers of a Twitch streamer. 🤷\nThis extremely active brony moved around a fair amount. Let’s look at some other users who barely moved at all. In the figure below, I’ve traced the paths of 10 of the least mobile users among the top 1000 most prolific.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe colors here are just meant to distinguish between users.\nAmong these users was one (the upper-leftmost one) who placed 539 pixels in roughly 58 hours. 443 of those pixels were placed in just a single location. That location? The upper left in the “connection lost” area (some kind of long-running inside joke). The color? Orange-red. That area pretty much never changed (and was always black). So this person basically accomplished nothing and was almost certainly a bot (more on that in a bit).\nAnother user in the figure above (the lime green colored one in the upper left) placed 501 pixels in a roughly a 50-hour period, all within a 36x41 pixel area. That area? The Canadian flag. The hilarious tragedy of the Canadian flag is documented here. What is impossible to determine is whether this person was trying to vandalize the flag or repair the vandalism."

    "text": "The rise of the bots 🤖\nAnother major controversy was over the use of “bots” – scripts that automatically placed pixels for you whenever your five-minute cool-down period was up. They weren’t forbidden, but some people saw them as a kind of cheating.\nAccusations of widespread bot use were common. But can we find evidence for that in the data?\nI looked at every user who placed at least 20 pixels. I then looked at the percentage of times they placed a pixel within 303 seconds (5 minutes + 3 seconds) of their last pixel. In other words, how often were they placing pixels almost as soon as they possibly could?\nHere are the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like bots were relatively rare. And contrary to my expectations, even among the users that placed hundreds of pixels, they weren’t generally more likely to be bots. Some people who placed 400+ pixels almost never placed them immediately after their 5 minute cool-off periods, suggesting they were placing them manually.\nI chose 3 seconds after the cool-off period ended somewhat arbitrarily, so I re-ran the analysis varying this delay from 0 to 10 seconds. Then I computed what percentage of pixels overall were placed within that period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, the longer the delay, the more pixels get included. But even for delays up to 10 seconds, no more than 15% of all pixels were placed.\nThe bottom line: Surely some people were using scripts. Perhaps as many as 5-10% of pixels were placed by scripts. But this analysis suggests that the vast majority of users weren’t using them and the vast majority of pixels were manually placed."
