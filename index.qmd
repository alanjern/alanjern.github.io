I'm an Associate Professor of Psychology and cognitive scientist at Rose-Hulman Institute of Psychology.

I use computational models and behavioral experiments to study how people think and reason. I'm primarily interested in social cognition: how people think about other people. I have also studied how people learn and use concepts, and how people revise their beliefs after seeing new evidence.

I write about TV and psychology at [Overthinking TV](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/overthinking-tv).
