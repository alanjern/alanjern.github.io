      <title>Teaching a seminar-style applied psychology course</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past quarter, I taught a new undergraduate course for non-majors about applications of psychology to everyday life. Roughly each week, we looked at a new topic, I assigned a few research articles and we discussed them in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a totally original idea, and I&amp;rsquo;m especially grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/samclab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Larisa Heiphetz&lt;/a&gt; for sharing the syllabus for her similar &amp;ldquo;FAQs About Life&amp;rdquo; course, and to Laurie Santos for making her free online Coursera course on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Science of Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the spirit of paying it forward, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d share what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/dqbt2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my syllabus&lt;/a&gt; with my list of readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;science-communication-&#34;&gt;Science communication üìù&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I focused on in the course was effective and accurate science writing, communication, and consumption. My thinking was: if students are going to be learning how to apply psychology to their lives, they also ought to learn a bit about the process by which research gets translated for public consumption too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had them read media reports about research in addition to the original research articles, and we talked about the strengths and weaknesses of the reports so they could learn how the media sometimes oversimplifies or exaggerates research results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the course ended with them writing their own blog posts summarizing a psychology research article of their choice, written for a general audience, with some kind of practical takeaway message. You can read their posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://appliedpsychwinter22.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned-&#34;&gt;What I learned üí≠&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the concepts we talk about in psych courses can feel divorced from everyday concerns. Personally, I loved teaching psychology through the lens of everyday applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave students a survey at the end of the quarter with a single question: What was the most important or useful thing you learned in this course? Here are a few of the most thoughtful responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing I learned in this course was the differences between the various ways to use social media. Normally, when social media comes up in a class, it is entirely bashing it. In this class however, we looked at how to use social media in a way that makes it beneficial, as well as how it can be dangerous only when used under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the deep and broad discussion on IQ. Intelligence is often both a weighty and a non-agreed-upon idea, so being able to hear a breadth of opinions in one place as well as a clear definition of what psychologists mean when they say IQ was helpful for me to gather my own thoughts on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was not one of the weekly subjects, one of the most useful things I can take away from this course is the confidence to read and understand academic papers. I feel less intimidated by the long length and dry language and more confident in my ability to understand the paper and notice its strengths and flaws. And I am more likely to read a study after seeing an article about it outside of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the coolest and most interesting stuff we talked about was the prejudice topic week. Looking at that topic that you hear a lot about in the news from a psychological side was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;want-more-&#34;&gt;Want more? üìö&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in teaching a class like this, feel free to contact me and I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to share any of my materials (e.g., assignments, rubrics).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching research methods using formr</title>
      <link>https://alanjern.github.io/post/teaching-research-methods-using-formr/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-course-&#34;&gt;The course üéí&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s useful to know a bit about my course first to help you decide if the information in this post will be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I teach doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any psych majors and my course doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any psych pre-reqs. It&amp;rsquo;s a small school that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a Qualtrics license. The students are mostly science and engineering majors so they are generally tech-savvy, but they don&amp;rsquo;t all have much programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course itself is focused on replication &amp;ndash; students don&amp;rsquo;t design their own studies &amp;ndash; and I choose which studies they will be replicating. So I have control over the complexity of the study designs they&amp;rsquo;ll be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can see the course syllabus &lt;a href=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/uploads/syllabi/methods_spring21.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I was looking for was a platform for running online studies that was free, pretty easy to learn, and had enough base functionality to create some simple study designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-formr-&#34;&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;formr&lt;/code&gt;? üõ†Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;formr.png&#34; alt=&#34;formr&#34; title=&#34;formr&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://formr.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;formr&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to alternatives, formr best met all these criteria. Some other options to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qualtrics.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/a&gt;: Most behavioral scientists already know Qualtrics. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and super flexible. But it&amp;rsquo;s not free and I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it where I work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psytoolkit.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PsyToolkit&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve used PsyToolkit in the past. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to learn, even for people with little programming experience. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a better choice over formr if you need to do more cognitive-type experiments where you control what people see on the screen at certain times and collect response time data. But I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the interface and it&amp;rsquo;s more advanced than what I needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jspsych.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;jsPsych&lt;/a&gt;: Another good choice if you want more advanced options. But it would require teaching more programming than my course had time for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-worked-&#34;&gt;What worked üëç&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the somewhat confusing &lt;a href=&#34;https://formr.org/documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, students caught on to the basics of formr pretty quickly. To supplement the official documentation, I made the following tutorial that you are welcome to share&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYESYTRufyE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any specific reports of this, another benefit of formr is that you initially build the experiment in Google Sheets, which was nice when students were working in groups because it was so easy for them to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-didnt-work-&#34;&gt;What didn&amp;rsquo;t work üôÑ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some issues with the &lt;code&gt;formr.org&lt;/code&gt; website itself. I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly grateful to the formr team, but it&amp;rsquo;s a small operation and it&amp;rsquo;s probably not equipped to handle the rising interest formr has received over the past year or so. I believe this was responsible for the two main problems I encountered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make experiments on the &lt;code&gt;formr.org&lt;/code&gt; website, you need an admin account, and new accounts have to be manually approved. After my students signed up, they weren&amp;rsquo;t approved for about 1.5 weeks. In the end, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t catastrophic, but our term is only 10 weeks, and it caused me to have to delay the deadline of the first formr-based assignment. &lt;em&gt;Not ideal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once students were in the thick of collecting data for their final projects, I got multiple reports of the formr site going down. Also &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that the formr team actually recommends installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;your own instance&lt;/a&gt; of formr so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t done this myself so I can&amp;rsquo;t say anything about it. But my plan for the next time I teach this course is to talk to the IT department at my school and see about installing formr on a college server. This should address the sign-up and downtime problems that we suffered this past term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr-&#34;&gt;tl;dr üìî&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;formr is free, requires no set-up (if you run it from the existing website) and can be used to do most of what Qualtrics can do with minimal learning. (It can do a lot more advanced stuff too if you are willing to learn more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great choice for research methods courses that want to offer students a simple solution for building good-looking ‚ú® and functional  ‚öôÔ∏è online studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned after I made this video that the advice I give in it for randomizing subjects equally between conditions is maybe not the optimal method (though it might be the simplest). See &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/g/formr/c/BRRxQi9pFhM/m/Hs2VyKCOAwAJ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
