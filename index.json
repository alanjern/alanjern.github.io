This is where I live and, as the local news noted, it was the third police death in the THPD in 10 years. For a city of only around 60,000, this seemed like a lot and led my wife to wonder if it was unusually high. I tried to find out.\nPhoto: WTHI\n The data 📒 🗄 I collected data on police officer deaths from the Officer Down Memorial Page. Their database includes “line of duty” deaths from all causes going back to before 1800. I decided to only collect data from 1980 to today (the most recent death in the database was the death in Terre Haute). So my analysis is only of deaths from the last ~30 years.\n🗄 Data on US county and city populations came from the US Census. This data includes annual population estimates going back about 10 years. For this analysis, I just decided to use the population numbers from the 2010 census.\n How I combined the data I made a few assumptions to get the data in a workable format. First, I narrowed the set of police deaths down to those that occurred in departments that had Police Department or Sheriff's Department in the name.\nThe police deaths dataset only included department names and states. So to determine the exact location of each department, I assumed each department was named after the city or county where it was located (e.g. Dallas Police Department in the city of Dallas). If a department didn’t follow this naming convention, it was excluded from analysis.\nFinally, I matched up the city and county names with the names in the census data sets. Sometimes they didn’t match. For example, Nashville appears in the census data set as Nashville-Davidson metropolitan government.\n Results Cumulative deaths compared to population First, let’s just compare city/county population to the cumulative number of officer deaths since 1980.\npopVsDeaths \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels, population \u0026lt;= 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;turquoise3\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels, population \u0026gt; 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;darkslategrey\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;orangered1\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) + scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\u0026quot;100\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Location Type\u0026quot;, title = str_c(\u0026quot;Officer Deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear)) + guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;))) print(popVsDeaths) ⚠️ One problem with this plot is that many departments showing zero deaths are actually mistakes. This is due to the overly simple department-location matching procedure I used.\nOne example is the Miami-Dade Police Department. This got included because it has the phrase Police Department in it. However, Miami-Dade is a county (a large one, with about 2.5 million people living there) and is identified as Miami-Dade County in my county population dataset. So the department name and county name fail to match because the word “county” doesn’t appear in the name of the department.\nThis actually happened a lot, so you can’t really trust all the zeros. But surely some of the zeros are accurate – it’s possible for a small-town department to have zero officer deaths. To not include them at all would also be a mistake. But I think including all the mistaken zeros ended up being a bigger mistake overall.\nSo here’s the same plot with the zeros removed.\npopVsDeaths2 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels2, population \u0026lt;= 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;turquoise3\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels2, population \u0026gt; 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;darkslategrey\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;orangered1\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) + scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\u0026quot;1,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Location\u0026quot;, title = str_c(\u0026quot;Officer Deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear), subtitle = \u0026quot;Locations where at least one death occurred\u0026quot;) + guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;))) print(popVsDeaths2) Many fewer departments (especially from small cities), but same basic shape. In both plots, I’ve colored small towns like Terre Haute in turquoise and also higlighted a few standout locations to help you orient yourself.\n Scaling by population These plots are a little hard to make sense of because the larger cities have way more deaths which squashes the plot vertically and makes it difficult to draw comparisons. So let’s try scaling the number of deaths by city/county population.\nNote: Arguably it would make more sense to scale by department size, but this information is harder to come by. I assume department size is correlated with population anyway.\nAlso, from this point on, I’m going to continue to exclude the zero-death locations for the reasons explained above.\nscaledPopsVsDeaths \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsNoZeros) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle open\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;coral3\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) + scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\u0026quot;1,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths per 10K\u0026quot;, size = \u0026quot;Total deaths\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Officer deaths per 10,000 in the department\u0026#39;s jurisdiction\u0026quot;, subtitle = str_c(\u0026quot;Cumulative deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear)) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;) print(scaledPopsVsDeaths) This plot suggests that Terre Haute is above average but maybe not a huge outlier, even among cities of similar population size.\nMore generally, this plot suggests there is not much of a relationship between city size and number of officer deaths, at least for cities above a certain size. The reason it looks like there is a relationship between population and deaths is almost certainly due to there being greater variability for smaller towns/departments. For example, a single death in a small town would have a big effect on this metric.\nSo let’s exclude small towns (population \u0026lt; 50,000) to get a better understanding.\nscaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = deathCounts_noSmallTowns) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle open\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights_noSmallTowns, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;coral3\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels_noSmallTowns, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4,5,6,7), labels = c(\u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths per 10K\u0026quot;, size = \u0026quot;Total deaths\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Officer deaths per 10,000 people in the department\u0026#39;s jurisdiction\u0026quot;, subtitle = str_c(\u0026quot;Cumulative deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear)) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;) print(scaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns) This plot allows us to get a better sense of variability, especially among midsize towns. In this plot, Terre Haute does look a bit more like an outlier. In more quantitative terms, among the locations in the plot above, Terre Haute is in the 99th percentile for officer deaths, scaled by population size. It drops to the 93rd percentile if you include the small towns that were in the previous plot.\n Officer deaths over time One last question I had was whether Terre Haute’s outlier status was driven by the last 10 years. To get a sense of this, let’s look at officer deaths over time.\ndeathsOverTime \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsByYear) + geom_step(mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long), alpha = 1/12) + geom_step(data = deathCountsByYearHighlights, mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long), color = \u0026quot;gold2\u0026quot;, alpha = 2/3) + geom_step(data = filter(deathCountsByYear, location_long == \u0026quot;Terre Haute, IN\u0026quot;), mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k), color = \u0026quot;coral3\u0026quot;, size = 1.5) + geom_text_repel(data = filter(deathCountsByYearHighlights, EOW == today()), mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long, label = location_long), size = 3) + labs(title = \u0026quot;Cumulative officer deaths\u0026quot;, subtitle = \u0026quot;Jurisdictions with populations \u0026gt; 50,000\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Total deaths per 10,000 residents\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() + theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) print(deathsOverTime) This plot shows cumulative deaths since 1980 for each department serving an area over 50,000 (again limited to only those departments that had at least one death). Terre Haute is highlighted. It gives the impression that Terre Haute wasn’t much of an outlier until the past 10 years when the last three officers died.\nIt also shows that no officers died in Terre Haute for several decades before 2011.\n  Conclusion ☑️ I think it’s fair to say that, right now, Terre Haute stands out statistically. The question is whether that’s indicative of anything meaningful. With thousands of jurisdictions across the US, some are bound to have unusually high numbers of deaths due to random chance alone. So it’s hard to draw any broad conclusions from these results without more information.\nFor example, speaking for myself, as someone pretty ignorant of law enforcement, I imagined “line of duty” deaths to be the result of attacks at the hands of suspects. But a number of the deaths in the dataset were caused by things like car crashes, Covid-19 (from the past two years), and heart attacks – things that happened while on the job but might be hard to attribute to the job itself. My point isn’t to diminish any of these deaths at all, only to point out that more deaths isn’t necessarily a sign of some systematic failure of a department. You would need to look at the causes of death (among other factors) before drawing a conclusion like that.\nCode and data 📑 Data and full analysis code to generate these plots are available here.\n  ","date":1625788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625788800,"objectID":"ce4c0b6d8b74588c409c064e68f8d462","permalink":"https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/","section":"post","summary":"A THPD detective was shot and killed this week, making it the third officer death in Terre Haute in the past 10 years.

It\u0026rsquo;s a small school that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a Qualtrics license. The students are mostly science and engineering majors so they are generally tech-savvy, but they don\u0026rsquo;t all have much programming experience.\nThe course itself is focused on replication \u0026ndash; students don\u0026rsquo;t design their own studies \u0026ndash; and I choose which studies they will be replicating. So I have control over the complexity of the study designs they\u0026rsquo;ll be using.\n(You can see the course syllabus here.)\nSo what I was looking for was a platform for running online studies that was free, pretty easy to learn, and had enough base functionality to create some simple study designs.\nWhat is formr? 🛠️ Enter formr. Compared to alternatives, formr best met all these criteria. Some other options to consider:\n Qualtrics: Most behavioral scientists already know Qualtrics. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to use and super flexible. But it\u0026rsquo;s not free and I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it where I work. PsyToolkit: I\u0026rsquo;ve used PsyToolkit in the past. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to learn, even for people with little programming experience. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a better choice over formr if you need to do more cognitive-type experiments where you control what people see on the screen at certain times and collect response time data. But I don\u0026rsquo;t really like the interface and it\u0026rsquo;s more advanced than what I needed. jsPsych: Another good choice if you want more advanced options. But it would require teaching more programming than my course had time for.  What worked 👍 Despite the somewhat confusing documentation, students caught on to the basics of formr pretty quickly. To supplement the official documentation, I made the following tutorial that you are welcome to share1.\n  Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t get any specific reports of this, another benefit of formr is that you initially build the experiment in Google Sheets, which was nice when students were working in groups because it was so easy for them to collaborate.\nWhat didn\u0026rsquo;t work 🙄 There were some issues with the formr.org website itself. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly grateful to the formr team, but it\u0026rsquo;s a small operation and it\u0026rsquo;s probably not equipped to handle the rising interest formr has received over the past year or so. I believe this was responsible for the two main problems I encountered:\n  In order to make experiments on the formr.org website, you need an admin account, and new accounts have to be manually approved. After my students signed up, they weren\u0026rsquo;t approved for about 1.5 weeks. In the end, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t catastrophic, but our term is only 10 weeks, and it caused me to have to delay the deadline of the first formr-based assignment. Not ideal.\n  Once students were in the thick of collecting data for their final projects, I got multiple reports of the formr site going down. Also not good.\n  The solution? I learned that the formr team actually recommends installing your own instance of formr so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to rely on their website.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t done this myself so I can\u0026rsquo;t say anything about it. But my plan for the next time I teach this course is to talk to the IT department at my school and see about installing formr on a college server. This should address the sign-up and downtime problems that we suffered this past term.\ntl;dr 📔 formr is free, requires no set-up (if you run it from the existing website) and can be used to do most of what Qualtrics can do with minimal learning. (It can do a lot more advanced stuff too if you are willing to learn more.)\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s a great choice for research methods courses that want to offer students a simple solution for building good-looking ✨ and functional ⚙️ online studies.\n  I learned after I made this video that the advice I give in it for randomizing subjects equally between conditions is maybe not the optimal method (though it might be the simplest).
