But this year, a new federal law went into effect requiring hospitals to publish all of their prices.\nI learned about this after reading this article in the New York Times by Sarah Kliff and Josh Katz. They analyzed the price lists at a number of hospitals and found some huge disparities in prices for identical treatments at the same hospitals and some puzzling discrepancies in insurers‚Äô negotiated prices. Notably, sometimes, the listed price for a treatment negotiated by an insurance company was higher than the listed price for a patient with no insurance at all. For insurance plans with high deductibles, this means you could potentially save money by not using your insurance for some treatments.\nThis got me curious about my own insurance and my own local hospital, so I decided to do a similar analysis.\nThe data üóí Union Hospital, the largest health care provider in my town, makes their price list available here. It includes a line for each treatment or procedure for each different insurer. It‚Äôs admittedly a little hard to make sense of. Here‚Äôs a small sample of the data.\n    Code Description Gross charge Max negotiated charge Min negotiated charge Insurer Charge    110.2 ear, nose, mouth, throat, cranial/facial malignancies 37,706.14 5,687.37 5,687.37 Caresource HIP 5687.37  110.2 ear, nose, mouth, throat, cranial/facial malignancies 37,706.14 5,687.37 5,687.37 Healthy Ind MD Wise 5687.37  110.2 ear, nose, mouth, throat, cranial/facial malignancies 37,706.14 5,687.37 5,687.37 Healthy Indiana Anthem 5687.37  110.2 ear, nose, mouth, throat, cranial/facial malignancies 37,706.14 5,687.37 5,687.37 MHS HIP 5687.37  110.4 ear, nose, mouth, throat, cranial/facial malignancies 50,000.16 13,963.29 13,963.29 Caresource HIP 13963.29  110.4 ear, nose, mouth, throat, cranial/facial malignancies 50,000.16 13,963.29 13,963.29 Healthy Ind MD Wise 13963.29    My interpretation of this is that the final column, Charge, is the result of the negotiation process and is what should be considered the final negotiated ‚Äúprice‚Äù of a procedure. The rest of my analysis is based on that assumption.\n Does my own insurance plan save me money? üíµ My insurance plan is Anthem Blue Access PPO. It‚Äôs part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield association, one of the biggest health insurance companies in the country. Like many people in the US, I get it through my employer and don‚Äôt really have much of a choice in the matter.\nI was first interested in whether Anthem‚Äôs negotiated prices at Union were at least as good as those charged to people with no insurance. As Matt Eyles, chief executive of America‚Äôs Health Insurance Plans says in the NYT article, ‚ÄúInsurers want to make sure they are negotiating the best deals they can for their members, to make sure their products have competitive premiums‚Äù.\nThis plot includes every treatment and procedure in Union‚Äôs price list (except for some extremely expensive ones). Each point is one procedure. Points that fall below the white diagonal line are actually cheaper with no insurance than with my Anthem insurance. Because there are so many points bunched up near the diagonal, it‚Äôs hard to tell that actually 91% of the points are on or above the line, suggesting that Anthem‚Äôs negotiated prices are generally good, relative to having no insurance (they are, unsurprisingly, much higher than Medicare‚Äôs prices).\nBut what are those remaining 9% of procedures? Imaging seems to account for a few. Union Hospital charges Anthem about $350 more for MRIs than it does for patients with no insurance. And it charges about $310 more for CT scans.\nFor some other procedures, prices vary depending on several factors, and sometimes Anthem‚Äôs price is lower, and sometimes it isn‚Äôt. For example, here are all the prices for colonoscopies in the price list.\n    Description Anthem price No insurance price    Colonoscopy through stoma; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by hot biopsy forceps 2688.12 1881.68  Colonoscopy, flexible; with removal of foreign body(s) 2593.67 1815.57  Colonoscopy, flexible; with control of bleeding, any method 2526.29 1768.41  Colonoscopy, flexible; with transendoscopic balloon dilation 2785.00 2102.55  Colonoscopy, flexible; with ablation of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) (includes pre- and post-dilation and guide wire passage, when performed) 2071.23 1449.86  Colonoscopy through stoma; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by snare technique 2785.00 2184.82  Colonoscopy, flexible; with directed submucosal injection(s), any substance 2785.00 2685.72  Colonoscopy, flexible; with band ligation(s) (eg, hemorrhoids) 3044.17 3466.60  Colonoscopy, flexible; diagnostic, including collection of specimen(s) by brushing or washing, when performed (separate procedure) 2785.00 3631.14  Colonoscopy, flexible; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by hot biopsy forceps 2785.00 3642.09  Colonoscopy, flexible; with biopsy, single or multiple 2785.00 3705.97  Colonoscopy, flexible; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by snare technique 2785.00 3705.97  Colonoscopy through stoma; diagnostic, including collection of specimen(s) by brushing or washing, when performed (separate procedure) 2785.00 3726.00  Colonoscopy through stoma; with biopsy, single or multiple 2785.00 3758.64    There doesn‚Äôt seem to be much rhyme or reason to when the Anthem prices are lower and when the cash (no insurance) prices are lower, but maybe I‚Äôm missing something. (There are some similar oddities in the pricing for C-sections.)\n How do Union Hospital‚Äôs negotiated prices compare overall? üìà The price list includes prices for nearly 150 different insurance plans. How do the rest of them fare? The plot below replicates the first plot but includes prices from all insurers. I‚Äôve separated out the five largest private insurers ‚Äì Aetna, Cigna, Humana, United, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\nAcross all procedures, insurers‚Äô negotiated prices don‚Äôt compare very favorably with Union Hospital‚Äôs cash prices for people with no insurance. The fact that ‚Äúnon-major‚Äù insurers‚Äô prices beat the cash prices only 34% of the time is especially surprising because that group includes several Medicare plans, whose prices are consistently very low (and almost certainly beat the cash prices every time).\n What does this mean? ü§® Information like this is potentially important for patients to have. But as the NYT article indicates, price discrepancies and inconsistencies are probably more embarrassing for the insurance companies than for the hospitals because the insurers want to be able to claim that they have negotiated competitive prices.\nHow seriously should we take this information? It‚Äôs probably hard to be sure. The price that gets charged for medical care surely depends on lots of factors. So I personally wouldn‚Äôt consider it a guarantee that because an entry in this list shows that a specific procedure is cheaper with no insurance that I‚Äôd be better off not using my insurance to get it.\nBut this information isn‚Äôt made up either. Hospitals do use these price lists as a starting point (at least) for billing. So I think it‚Äôs reasonable to use these price lists to draw some broadly valid conclusions about the value of your health insurance and the approximate costs of your health care.\n How much does this matter? One last point I haven‚Äôt addressed is that the price charged by the hospital is not the same thing as the price you owe as an individual. The difference between a price tag of $50,000 and $60,000 may be irrelevant to you if you have health insurance with a deductible of $2,000 that pays all costs after that deductible is met. So some of these price discrepancies are problems for insurance companies, not for consumers.\nBut, as you‚Äôll note above, some of the cases where Anthem is beat by the ‚Äúno insurance‚Äù rates are well below common deductibles. So these cost differences can affect how much you are paying üíµ.\nCode and data üìë Code and data for this analysis is available here.\n   ","date":1630022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630022400,"objectID":"9a9954080b66c2c7e6a04799f4aea3d5","permalink":"https://alanjern.github.io/post/can-you-save-money-at-union-hospital-by-not-using-insurance/","publishdate":"2021-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/can-you-save-money-at-union-hospital-by-not-using-insurance/","section":"post","summary":"Due to a new federal law, hospitals must publish their price lists.

This is where I live and, as the local news noted, it was the third police death in the THPD in 10 years. For a city of only around 60,000, this seemed like a lot and led my wife to wonder if it was unusually high. I tried to find out.\nPhoto: WTHI\n The data üìí üóÑ I collected data on police officer deaths from the Officer Down Memorial Page. Their database includes ‚Äúline of duty‚Äù deaths from all causes going back to before 1800. I decided to only collect data from 1980 to today (the most recent death in the database was the death in Terre Haute). So my analysis is only of deaths from the last ~40 years.\nüóÑ Data on US county and city populations came from the US Census. This data includes annual population estimates going back about 10 years. For this analysis, I just decided to use the population numbers from the 2010 census.\n How I combined the data I made a few assumptions to get the data in a workable format. First, I narrowed the set of police deaths down to those that occurred in departments that had Police Department or Sheriff's Department in the name.\nThe police deaths dataset only included department names and states. So to determine the exact location of each department, I assumed each department was named after the city or county where it was located (e.g.¬†Dallas Police Department in the city of Dallas). If a department didn‚Äôt follow this naming convention, it was excluded from analysis.\nFinally, I matched up the city and county names with the names in the census data sets. Sometimes they didn‚Äôt match. For example, Nashville appears in the census data set as Nashville-Davidson metropolitan government.\n Results Cumulative deaths compared to population First, let‚Äôs just compare city/county population to the cumulative number of officer deaths since 1980.\npopVsDeaths \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels, population \u0026lt;= 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;turquoise3\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels, population \u0026gt; 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;darkslategrey\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;orangered1\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) + scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\u0026quot;100\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Location Type\u0026quot;, title = str_c(\u0026quot;Officer Deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear)) + guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;))) print(popVsDeaths) ‚ö†Ô∏è One problem with this plot is that many departments showing zero deaths are actually mistakes. This is due to the overly simple department-location matching procedure I used.\nOne example is the Miami-Dade Police Department. This got included because it has the phrase Police Department in it. However, Miami-Dade is a county (a large one, with about 2.5 million people living there) and is identified as Miami-Dade County in my county population dataset. So the department name and county name fail to match because the word ‚Äúcounty‚Äù doesn‚Äôt appear in the name of the department.\nThis actually happened a lot, so you can‚Äôt really trust all the zeros. But surely some of the zeros are accurate. For example, this site reports that 16 out of Indiana‚Äôs 92 counties have had no ‚Äúline of duty‚Äù deaths. To not include departments with no deaths would be a mistake. But given the dataset I had, there wasn‚Äôt a reliable way to identify those departments, and I knew for a fact that many of the zeros I found were simply due to name mismatches. So I decided it was best overall to just remove the zeros entirely.\nHere‚Äôs the same plot with the zeros removed.\npopVsDeaths2 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels2, population \u0026lt;= 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;turquoise3\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels2, population \u0026gt; 75000), mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;darkslategrey\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType), color = \u0026quot;orangered1\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) + scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\u0026quot;1,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Location\u0026quot;, title = str_c(\u0026quot;Officer Deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear), subtitle = \u0026quot;Locations where at least one death occurred\u0026quot;) + guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;))) print(popVsDeaths2) Many fewer departments (especially from small cities), but same basic shape. In both plots, I‚Äôve colored small towns like Terre Haute in turquoise and also higlighted a few standout locations to help you orient yourself.\n Scaling by population These plots are a little hard to make sense of because the larger cities have way more deaths which squashes the plot vertically and makes it difficult to draw comparisons. So let‚Äôs try scaling the number of deaths by city/county population.\nNote: Arguably it would make more sense to scale by department size, but this information is harder to come by. I assume department size is correlated with population anyway.\nAlso, from this point on, I‚Äôm going to continue to exclude the zero-death locations for the reasons explained above.\nscaledPopsVsDeaths \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsNoZeros) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle open\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;coral3\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) + scale_x_continuous(labels = c(\u0026quot;1,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths per 10K\u0026quot;, size = \u0026quot;Total deaths\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Officer deaths per 10,000 in the department\u0026#39;s jurisdiction\u0026quot;, subtitle = str_c(\u0026quot;Cumulative deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear)) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;) print(scaledPopsVsDeaths) This plot suggests that Terre Haute is above average but maybe not a huge outlier, even among cities of similar population size.\nMore generally, this plot suggests there is not much of a relationship between city size and number of officer deaths, at least for cities above a certain size. The reason it looks like there is a relationship between population and deaths is almost certainly due to there being greater variability for smaller towns/departments. For example, a single death in a small town would have a big effect on this metric.\nSo let‚Äôs exclude small towns (population \u0026lt; 50,000) to get a better understanding.\nscaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = deathCounts_noSmallTowns) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle open\u0026quot;, alpha = 1/3) + geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights_noSmallTowns, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths), shape = \u0026quot;circle\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;coral3\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels_noSmallTowns, mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths, label = locationLabel), size = 3) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4,5,6,7), labels = c(\u0026quot;10,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;100,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1,000,000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;10,000,000\u0026quot;)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Population\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Deaths per 10K\u0026quot;, size = \u0026quot;Total deaths\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Officer deaths per 10,000 people in the department\u0026#39;s jurisdiction\u0026quot;, subtitle = str_c(\u0026quot;Cumulative deaths, \u0026quot;, startingYear, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, finalYear)) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;) print(scaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns) This plot allows us to get a better sense of variability, especially among midsize towns. In this plot, Terre Haute does look a bit more like an outlier. In more quantitative terms, among the locations in the plot above, Terre Haute is in the 99th percentile for officer deaths, scaled by population size. It drops to the 93rd percentile if you include the small towns that were in the previous plot.\n Officer deaths over time One last question I had was whether Terre Haute‚Äôs outlier status was driven by the last 10 years. To get a sense of this, let‚Äôs look at officer deaths over time.\ndeathsOverTime \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsByYear) + geom_step(mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long), alpha = 1/12) + geom_step(data = deathCountsByYearHighlights, mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long), color = \u0026quot;gold2\u0026quot;, alpha = 2/3) + geom_step(data = filter(deathCountsByYear, location_long == \u0026quot;Terre Haute, IN\u0026quot;), mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k), color = \u0026quot;coral3\u0026quot;, size = 1.5) + geom_text_repel(data = filter(deathCountsByYearHighlights, EOW == today()), mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long, label = location_long), size = 3) + labs(title = \u0026quot;Cumulative officer deaths\u0026quot;, subtitle = \u0026quot;Jurisdictions with populations \u0026gt; 50,000\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Total deaths per 10,000 residents\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() + theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) print(deathsOverTime) This plot shows cumulative deaths since 1980 for each department serving an area over 50,000 (again limited to only those departments that had at least one death). Terre Haute is highlighted. It gives the impression that Terre Haute wasn‚Äôt much of an outlier until the past 10 years when the last three officers died.\nIt also shows that no officers died in Terre Haute for several decades before 2011.\n  Conclusion ‚òëÔ∏è I think it‚Äôs fair to say that, right now, Terre Haute stands out statistically. The question is whether that‚Äôs indicative of anything meaningful. With thousands of jurisdictions across the US, some are bound to have unusually high numbers of deaths due to random chance alone. So it‚Äôs hard to draw any broad conclusions from these results without more information.\nFor example, speaking for myself, as someone pretty ignorant of law enforcement, I imagined ‚Äúline of duty‚Äù deaths to be the result of attacks at the hands of suspects. But a number of the deaths in the dataset were caused by things like car crashes, Covid-19 (from the past two years), and heart attacks ‚Äì things that happened while on the job but might be hard to attribute to the job itself. My point isn‚Äôt to diminish any of these deaths at all, only to point out that more deaths isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign of some underlying cause or problem. You would need to look at the causes of death (among other factors) before drawing a conclusion like that.\nCode and data üìë Data and the full analysis code I used to generate these plots are available here.\n  ","date":1625788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625788800,"objectID":"ce4c0b6d8b74588c409c064e68f8d462","permalink":"https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/","section":"post","summary":"A THPD detective was shot and killed this week, making it the third officer death in Terre Haute, Indiana in the past 10 years.

It\u0026rsquo;s a small school that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a Qualtrics license. The students are mostly science and engineering majors so they are generally tech-savvy, but they don\u0026rsquo;t all have much programming experience.\nThe course itself is focused on replication \u0026ndash; students don\u0026rsquo;t design their own studies \u0026ndash; and I choose which studies they will be replicating. So I have control over the complexity of the study designs they\u0026rsquo;ll be using.\n(You can see the course syllabus here.)\nSo what I was looking for was a platform for running online studies that was free, pretty easy to learn, and had enough base functionality to create some simple study designs.\nWhat is formr? üõ†Ô∏è Enter formr. Compared to alternatives, formr best met all these criteria. Some other options to consider:\n Qualtrics: Most behavioral scientists already know Qualtrics. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to use and super flexible. But it\u0026rsquo;s not free and I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it where I work. PsyToolkit: I\u0026rsquo;ve used PsyToolkit in the past. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to learn, even for people with little programming experience. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a better choice over formr if you need to do more cognitive-type experiments where you control what people see on the screen at certain times and collect response time data. But I don\u0026rsquo;t really like the interface and it\u0026rsquo;s more advanced than what I needed. jsPsych: Another good choice if you want more advanced options. But it would require teaching more programming than my course had time for.  What worked üëç Despite the somewhat confusing documentation, students caught on to the basics of formr pretty quickly. To supplement the official documentation, I made the following tutorial that you are welcome to share1.\n  Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t get any specific reports of this, another benefit of formr is that you initially build the experiment in Google Sheets, which was nice when students were working in groups because it was so easy for them to collaborate.\nWhat didn\u0026rsquo;t work üôÑ There were some issues with the formr.org website itself. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly grateful to the formr team, but it\u0026rsquo;s a small operation and it\u0026rsquo;s probably not equipped to handle the rising interest formr has received over the past year or so. I believe this was responsible for the two main problems I encountered:\n  In order to make experiments on the formr.org website, you need an admin account, and new accounts have to be manually approved. After my students signed up, they weren\u0026rsquo;t approved for about 1.5 weeks. In the end, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t catastrophic, but our term is only 10 weeks, and it caused me to have to delay the deadline of the first formr-based assignment. Not ideal.\n  Once students were in the thick of collecting data for their final projects, I got multiple reports of the formr site going down. Also not good.\n  The solution? I learned that the formr team actually recommends installing your own instance of formr so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to rely on their website.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t done this myself so I can\u0026rsquo;t say anything about it. But my plan for the next time I teach this course is to talk to the IT department at my school and see about installing formr on a college server. This should address the sign-up and downtime problems that we suffered this past term.\ntl;dr üìî formr is free, requires no set-up (if you run it from the existing website) and can be used to do most of what Qualtrics can do with minimal learning. (It can do a lot more advanced stuff too if you are willing to learn more.)\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s a great choice for research methods courses that want to offer students a simple solution for building good-looking ‚ú® and functional ‚öôÔ∏è online studies.\n  I learned after I made this video that the advice I give in it for randomizing subjects equally between conditions is maybe not the optimal method (though it might be the simplest).
