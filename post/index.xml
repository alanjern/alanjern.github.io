      <title>Teaching a seminar-style applied psychology course</title>
      <link>https://alanjern.github.io/post/teaching-a-seminar-style-applied-psychology-course/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alanjern.github.io/post/teaching-a-seminar-style-applied-psychology-course/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past quarter, I taught a new undergraduate course for non-majors about applications of psychology to everyday life. Roughly each week, we looked at a new topic, I assigned a few research articles and we discussed them in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a totally original idea, and I&amp;rsquo;m especially grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/samclab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Larisa Heiphetz&lt;/a&gt; for sharing the syllabus for her similar &amp;ldquo;FAQs About Life&amp;rdquo; course, and to Laurie Santos for making her free online Coursera course on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Science of Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the spirit of paying it forward, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d share what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/dqbt2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my syllabus&lt;/a&gt; with my list of readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;science-communication-&#34;&gt;Science communication üìù&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I focused on in the course was effective and accurate science writing, communication, and consumption. My thinking was: if students are going to be learning how to apply psychology to their lives, they also ought to learn a bit about the process by which research gets translated for public consumption too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had them read media reports about research in addition to the original research articles, and we talked about the strengths and weaknesses of the reports so they could learn how the media sometimes oversimplifies or exaggerates research results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the course ended with them writing their own blog posts summarizing a psychology research article of their choice, written for a general audience, with some kind of practical takeaway message. You can read their posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://appliedpsychwinter22.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned-&#34;&gt;What I learned üí≠&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the concepts we talk about in psych courses can feel divorced from everyday concerns. Personally, I loved teaching psychology through the lens of everyday applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave students a survey at the end of the quarter with a single question: What was the most important or useful thing you learned in this course? Here are a few of the most thoughtful responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing I learned in this course was the differences between the various ways to use social media. Normally, when social media comes up in a class, it is entirely bashing it. In this class however, we looked at how to use social media in a way that makes it beneficial, as well as how it can be dangerous only when used under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the deep and broad discussion on IQ. Intelligence is often both a weighty and a non-agreed-upon idea, so being able to hear a breadth of opinions in one place as well as a clear definition of what psychologists mean when they say IQ was helpful for me to gather my own thoughts on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was not one of the weekly subjects, one of the most useful things I can take away from this course is the confidence to read and understand academic papers. I feel less intimidated by the long length and dry language and more confident in my ability to understand the paper and notice its strengths and flaws. And I am more likely to read a study after seeing an article about it outside of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the coolest and most interesting stuff we talked about was the prejudice topic week. Looking at that topic that you hear a lot about in the news from a psychological side was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;want-more-&#34;&gt;Want more? üìö&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in teaching a class like this, feel free to contact me and I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to share any of my materials (e.g., assignments, rubrics).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When are waits lowest at Disney World?</title>
      <link>https://alanjern.github.io/post/when-are-waits-lowest-at-disney-world/</link>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/when-are-waits-lowest-at-disney-world/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I love Disney World. I hate waiting in line. Sadly you can‚Äôt go to Disney World without waiting in line. But if you plan ahead, you can keep the waiting to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of that planning is going at the right time. Visitors are somewhat predictable: they don‚Äôt visit uniformly throughout the year. If you have the flexibility, you can minimize your wait times by going when other people aren‚Äôt. But when are those times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to answer that question, I found a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/crowd-calendar#DataSets&#34;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; from Touring Plans of posted wait times for several attractions in each park every few minutes of each day going back to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-year-at-magic-kingdom-in-waits&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A year at Magic Kingdom in waits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Magic Kingdom, Touring Plans has data for three attractions: &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Seven Dwarfs Mine Train&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Splash Mountain&lt;/em&gt;. To get a sense of how waits at Magic Kingdom vary over the calender year, I took waits from every day between January 1st, 2015 and March 15, 2020 (the last day Disney World was open before it shut down for Covid), dropped the year (combining, for example, all waits from January 1st from all years), then computed the mean waits for each day of the year based on the three attractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/when-are-waits-lowest-at-disney-world/index_files/figure-html/plot-yearly-average-waits-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot also shows US holidays (some holidays fell on different days between 2015 and 2021), and estimates of public school breaks. School breaks vary a lot, so I just went with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ocps.net/about_us/calendars/historical_calendars&#34;&gt;dates of the Orange County Public School district&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, which includes Orlando. The data on US holidays comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/shivaas/4758439&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few conclusions that you can draw from this plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waits spike during holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waits rise in the summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waits rise in late March/early April, probably due to Spring break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waits seem to be lowest in the Fall and early December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On any given day, waits vary a lot. The gray bands show the boundaries between the 25th and 75th percentiles for waits each day for the five years in the data. For example, the mean wait on January 1st is 52 minutes, but 25% of the posted waits on that day for the three attractions were under 20 minutes and 25% of the posted waits were over 75 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Year‚Äôs Eve is hell at Magic Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot is already pretty helpful, but it would be nice if we would be a little more precise. That is, can we use a statistical model to say, in quantitative terms, how much better or worse the best and worst times to visit are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-much-of-a-difference-does-the-time-of-year-make&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much of a difference does the time of year make?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fit a linear regression model that used week of the year and whether the day was within a day of a holiday to predict wait times. (Including whether a day was during a school break didn‚Äôt make much difference in terms of predictions, probably because week of the year already captured most of what ‚Äúbreak time‚Äù would.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, &lt;strong&gt;days that are on or near holidays have average waits that are about 6 minutes longer than days that aren‚Äôt&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of week are shown below. Because the actual wait times are somewhat meaningless (they are just averages of three attractions), I‚Äôve plotted changes in terms of percent. These changes are relative to Week 16 of the year (around mid-April), which is pretty close to an average week at Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/when-are-waits-lowest-at-disney-world/index_files/figure-html/show-modeling-results-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best weeks&lt;/strong&gt; to visit in terms of low waits are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September through early October, when waits can decrease by 20-30% from baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first half of December, when waits can decrease by about 20% from baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;worst weeks&lt;/strong&gt; to visit are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last two weeks of the year and the first week of the year, when waits can increase by over 20% from baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late March to early April, when waits can increase by about 20% from baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mid-July to early August, when waits can increase by 15-20% from baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And don‚Äôt ever go to Disney World on New Years Eve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-has-covid-affected-waits&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How has Covid affected waits?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney World shut down due to Covid on March 15th, 2020. It reopened on July 11th that same year and has remained open ever since. It changed a lot of its operations after reopening. And, initially, visitors were skittish about returning. So how have wait times changed since reopening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I compared the model‚Äôs predicted wait times to the posted wait times from the Touring Plans dataset, collected from the date of reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/when-are-waits-lowest-at-disney-world/index_files/figure-html/compare-predictions-to-post-covid-data-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that there‚Äôs a lot of missing data in the Fall of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot suggests that, since reopening, wait times have generally been a little lower than average, except for maybe in July 2021. However, it looks like waits are beginning to return to their usual patterns as of this past Fall. It‚Äôs probably too soon to say whether it‚Äôs a persisent pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, we can do the same analysis for a different park. I fit another model using the same method with Touring Plans data for the Hollywood Studios park in Disney World. Touring Plans provides wait times for four attractions in Hollywood Studios: &lt;em&gt;Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roller Coaster&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Alien Swirling Saucers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slinky Dog Dash&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story Mania&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the comparable plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/when-are-waits-lowest-at-disney-world/index_files/figure-html/compare-hs-preidctions-to-post-covid-data-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern is basically the same. Generally lower-than-expected waits and an apparent return to normal starting this past Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;should-i-book-my-trip&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should I book my trip?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a check, I compared my work to the weekly ranking developed by Dave Shute of &lt;a href=&#34;https://yourfirstvisit.net/&#34;&gt;yourfirstvisit.net&lt;/a&gt;. Dave doesn‚Äôt base his recommendations on statistics and data analysis. Instead, they‚Äôre based on his years of firsthand knowledge and experience. &lt;a href=&#34;https://yourfirstvisit.net/2021/01/11/the-best-weeks-in-2021-to-visit-walt-disney-world-ranked-in-order/&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are his recommendations for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/yfw_bestweeks_2021.png&#34; alt=&#34;yourfirsrtvisit‚Äôs 2021 Disney World weekly visit rankings&#34; /&gt;
Surprisingly, his recommendations don‚Äôt align with mine much at all. Some of his top-ranked weeks are in the middle of summer. After that, he recommends going in mid-April and early May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;whats-going-on&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What‚Äôs going on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Dave factors in more than crowd levels. He considers things like weather and ride closures. September may be a low-crowd time but it‚Äôs also peak hurricane season. And low-crowd times tend to coincide with suboptimal experiences: Disney is well aware of these seasonal patterns, so they reduce operating hours and schedule attraction refurbishments in the off-season. This means you may get less time in the park and fewer things to do if you go during a less popular time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if your goal is to have the best overall experience (which Dave‚Äôs advice is targeted toward), choosing the the lowest-crowd time may not actually be best.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Dave may have some knowledge not captured in the data. He seems to discount some of the weeks (like in early December) as heavy-crowd times that my analysis predicts will have lower than average waits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;okay-but-all-i-care-about-is-short-waits.-should-i-book-my-trip-now&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Okay, but all I care about is short waits. Should I book my trip &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All else being equal, lower waits are better. But is this data giving an accurate picture of wait times? Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that the dataset only includes a few attractions per park, the data are &lt;em&gt;posted&lt;/em&gt; wait times, not &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; wait times. Disney is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.disneytouristblog.com/actual-versus-posted-wait-times-disney-world/&#34;&gt;notorious&lt;/a&gt; for inflating posted wait times. After all, people are happier when they get in a line expecting to wait 30 minutes and only end up waiting 15 than when they get in a line expecting to wait 15 and end up waiting 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, ever since Disney parks started posting wait times on their mobile apps, it‚Äôs been strongly suspected that they intentionally manipulate posted wait times to disperse crowds. For example, they might inflate wait times in Tomorrowland to push people toward Frontierland on the other side of the park. (To learn more about this, along with the fascinating history of FastPasses and their influence on wait times, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/9yjZpBq1XBE&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; nearly two-hour long video. It‚Äôs really interesting, I promise!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you probably shouldn‚Äôt take the absolute numbers too seriously. But if waits are consistently inflated year-round, you can probably expect to encounter shorter waits in September than in June, for example, and you can treat this data as an indirect measure of crowds levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a clear seasonal pattern to waits (or, perhaps more accurately, crowd levels) at Disney World. Exactly how much impact this will have on the quality of your visit is hard to say because that depends on many more factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But, for the love of God, don‚Äôt go to Disney World on New Year‚Äôs Eve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code-and-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code and data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and the full analysis code I used to generate these plots are available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alanjern/wdw-waits&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can you save money at Union Hospital by not using insurance?</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/can-you-save-money-at-union-hospital-by-not-using-insurance/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the many frustrating things about health care in the US is not having a clue what things are going to cost. But this year, a new federal law went into effect requiring hospitals to publish all of their prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned about this after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/22/upshot/hospital-prices.html&#34;&gt;this article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; by Sarah Kliff and Josh Katz. They analyzed the price lists at a number of hospitals and found some huge disparities in prices for identical treatments at the same hospitals and some puzzling discrepancies in insurers‚Äô negotiated prices. Notably, sometimes, the listed price for a treatment negotiated by an insurance company was &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; than the listed price for a patient with no insurance at all. For insurance plans with high deductibles, this means you could potentially save money by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; using your insurance for some treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me curious about my own insurance and my own local hospital, so I decided to do a similar analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The data üóí&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Hospital, the largest health care provider in my town, makes their price list available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myunionhealth.org/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/billing-and-insurance/online-estimate/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a line for each treatment or procedure for each different insurer. It‚Äôs admittedly a little hard to make sense of. Here‚Äôs a small sample of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;4%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;36%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interpretation of this is that the final column, &lt;code&gt;Charge&lt;/code&gt;, is the result of the negotiation process and is what should be considered the final negotiated ‚Äúprice‚Äù of a procedure. The rest of my analysis is based on that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;does-my-own-insurance-plan-save-me-money&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Does my own insurance plan save me money? üíµ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My insurance plan is &lt;strong&gt;Anthem Blue Access PPO&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield association, one of the biggest health insurance companies in the country. Like many people in the US, I get it through my employer and don‚Äôt really have much of a choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was first interested in whether Anthem‚Äôs negotiated prices at Union were at least as good as those charged to people with no insurance. As Matt Eyles, chief executive of America‚Äôs Health Insurance Plans says in the NYT article, ‚ÄúInsurers want to make sure they are negotiating the best deals they can for their members, to make sure their products have competitive premiums‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/can-you-save-money-at-union-hospital-by-not-using-insurance/index_files/figure-html/plot-anthem-vs-self-pay-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot includes every treatment and procedure in Union‚Äôs price list (except for some extremely expensive ones). Each point is one procedure. Points that fall below the white diagonal line are actually cheaper with no insurance than with my Anthem insurance. Because there are so many points bunched up near the diagonal, it‚Äôs hard to tell that actually 91% of the points are on or above the line, suggesting that Anthem‚Äôs negotiated prices are generally good, relative to having no insurance (they are, unsurprisingly, much higher than Medicare‚Äôs prices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are those remaining 9% of procedures? Imaging seems to account for a few. &lt;strong&gt;Union Hospital charges Anthem about $350 more for MRIs than it does for patients with no insurance.&lt;/strong&gt; And it charges about &lt;strong&gt;$310 more for CT scans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some other procedures, prices vary depending on several factors, and sometimes Anthem‚Äôs price is lower, and sometimes it isn‚Äôt. For example, here are all the prices for colonoscopies in the price list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;3758.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There doesn‚Äôt seem to be much rhyme or reason to when the Anthem prices are lower and when the cash (no insurance) prices are lower, but maybe I‚Äôm missing something. (There are some similar oddities in the pricing for C-sections.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/can-you-save-money-at-union-hospital-by-not-using-insurance/index_files/figure-html/compare-prices-for-key-procedures-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-union-hospitals-negotiated-prices-compare-overall&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How do Union Hospital‚Äôs negotiated prices compare overall? üìà&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price list includes prices for nearly 150 different insurance plans. How do the rest of them fare? The plot below replicates the first plot but includes prices from all insurers. I‚Äôve separated out the five largest private insurers ‚Äì Aetna, Cigna, Humana, United, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/can-you-save-money-at-union-hospital-by-not-using-insurance/index_files/figure-html/compare-all-insurers-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across all procedures, insurers‚Äô negotiated prices don‚Äôt compare very favorably with Union Hospital‚Äôs cash prices for people with no insurance. The fact that ‚Äúnon-major‚Äù insurers‚Äô prices beat the cash prices only 34% of the time is especially surprising because that group includes several Medicare plans, whose prices are consistently very low (and almost certainly beat the cash prices every time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-does-this-mean&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What does this mean? ü§®&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information like this is potentially important for patients to have. But as the NYT article indicates, price discrepancies and inconsistencies are probably more embarrassing for the insurance companies than for the hospitals because the insurers want to be able to claim that they have negotiated competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-seriously-should-we-take-this-information&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How seriously should we take this information?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs probably hard to be sure. The price that gets charged for medical care surely depends on lots of factors. So I personally wouldn‚Äôt consider it a guarantee that because an entry in this list shows that a specific procedure is cheaper with no insurance that I‚Äôd be better off not using my insurance to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this information isn‚Äôt made up either. Hospitals &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use these price lists as a starting point (at least) for billing. So I think it‚Äôs reasonable to use these price lists to draw some broadly valid conclusions about the value of your health insurance and the approximate costs of your health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-much-does-this-matter&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much does this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last point I haven‚Äôt addressed is that the price charged by the hospital is not the same thing as the price you owe as an individual. The difference between a price tag of $50,000 and $60,000 may be irrelevant to you if you have health insurance with a deductible of $2,000 that pays all costs after that deductible is met. So some of these price discrepancies are problems for insurance companies, not for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as you‚Äôll note above, some of the cases where Anthem is beat by the ‚Äúno insurance‚Äù rates are well below common deductibles. So these cost differences can affect how much you are paying üíµ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code-and-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code and data üìë&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code and data for this analysis is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alanjern/union-hospital-prices&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Background üîé&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Terre Haute Police Department Detective Greg Ferency &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/us/indiana-police-officer-fbi-task-force-ambushed/index.html&#34;&gt;was shot&lt;/a&gt; on the job. This is where I live and, as the local news &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wthitv.com/content/news/Three-Terre-Haute-Police-Department-deaths-in-10-years---the-citys-mayor-shares-his-thoughts-574794821.html&#34;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, it was the third police death in the THPD in 10 years. For a city of only around 60,000, this seemed like a lot and led my wife to wonder if it was unusually high. I tried to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crime-scene-wthi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Crime scene photo&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Photo: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wthitv.com/content/news/Police-search-for-suspect-after-an-officer-was-shot-in-Terre-Haute-574784911.html&#34;&gt;WTHI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The data üìí&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üóÑ I collected data on police officer deaths from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.odmp.org/&#34;&gt;Officer Down Memorial Page&lt;/a&gt;. Their database includes ‚Äúline of duty‚Äù deaths from all causes going back to before 1800. I decided to only collect data from 1980 to today (the most recent death in the database was the death in Terre Haute). So my analysis is only of deaths from the last ~40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üóÑ Data on US &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html&#34;&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-cities-and-towns.html&#34;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; populations came from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/en.html&#34;&gt;US Census&lt;/a&gt;. This data includes annual population estimates going back about 10 years. For this analysis, I just decided to use the population numbers from the 2010 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-i-combined-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How I combined the data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a few assumptions to get the data in a workable format. First, I narrowed the set of police deaths down to those that occurred in departments that had &lt;code&gt;Police Department&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Sheriff&#39;s Department&lt;/code&gt; in the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police deaths dataset only included department names and states. So to determine the exact location of each department, I assumed each department was named after the city or county where it was located (e.g.¬†Dallas Police Department in the city of Dallas). If a department didn‚Äôt follow this naming convention, it was excluded from analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I matched up the city and county names with the names in the census data sets. Sometimes they didn‚Äôt match. For example, Nashville appears in the census data set as &lt;code&gt;Nashville-Davidson metropolitan government&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cumulative-deaths-compared-to-population&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cumulative deaths compared to population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let‚Äôs just compare city/county population to the cumulative number of officer deaths since 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;popVsDeaths &amp;lt;- ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels, population &amp;lt;= 75000),
             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType),
             color = &amp;quot;turquoise3&amp;quot;, alpha = 1/3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(data = filter(deathCountsWithLabels, population &amp;gt; 75000),
             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType),
             color = &amp;quot;darkslategrey&amp;quot;, alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights,
             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, shape = locationType),
             color = &amp;quot;orangered1&amp;quot;,
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels,
                  mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = numDeaths, label = locationLabel),
                  size = 3,
                  max.overlaps = Inf) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1,000,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10,000,000&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Population&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Deaths&amp;quot;,
       shape = &amp;quot;Location Type&amp;quot;,
       title = str_c(&amp;quot;Officer Deaths, &amp;quot;, startingYear, &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;, finalYear)) +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;)))
print(popVsDeaths)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/index_files/figure-html/pop-vs-deaths-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ö†Ô∏è One problem with this plot is that many departments showing zero deaths are actually mistakes. This is due to the overly simple department-location matching procedure I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the Miami-Dade Police Department. This got included because it has the phrase &lt;code&gt;Police Department&lt;/code&gt; in it. However, Miami-Dade is a county (a large one, with about 2.5 million people living there) and is identified as &lt;code&gt;Miami-Dade County&lt;/code&gt; in my county population dataset. So the department name and county name fail to match because the word ‚Äúcounty‚Äù doesn‚Äôt appear in the name of the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually happened a lot, so you can‚Äôt really trust all the zeros. But surely some of the zeros are accurate. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://inlem.org/lodd-stats/&#34;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; reports that 16 out of Indiana‚Äôs 92 counties have had no ‚Äúline of duty‚Äù deaths. To not include departments with no deaths would be a mistake. But given the dataset I had, there wasn‚Äôt a reliable way to identify those departments, and I knew for a fact that many of the zeros I found were simply due to name mismatches. So I decided it was best overall to just remove the zeros entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the same plot with the zeros removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;popVsDeaths2 &amp;lt;- ggplot() +

       subtitle = &amp;quot;Locations where at least one death occurred&amp;quot;) +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, color = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;)))
print(popVsDeaths2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many fewer departments (especially from small cities), but same basic shape. In both plots, I‚Äôve colored small towns like Terre Haute in turquoise and also higlighted a few standout locations to help you orient yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;scaling-by-population&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling by population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These plots are a little hard to make sense of because the larger cities have way more deaths which squashes the plot vertically and makes it difficult to draw comparisons. So let‚Äôs try scaling the number of deaths by city/county population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Arguably it would make more sense to scale by department size, but this information is harder to come by. I assume department size is correlated with population anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also, from this point on, I‚Äôm going to continue to exclude the zero-death locations for the reasons explained above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;scaledPopsVsDeaths &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsNoZeros) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),
             shape = &amp;quot;circle open&amp;quot;,
             alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights2,
             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),
             shape = &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;,
             color = &amp;quot;coral3&amp;quot;,
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels2,
                  mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths,
                                label = locationLabel),
                  size = 3,
                  max.overlaps = Inf) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(&amp;quot;1,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1,000,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10,000,000&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Population&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Deaths per 10K&amp;quot;,
       size = &amp;quot;Total deaths&amp;quot;,
       title = &amp;quot;Officer deaths per 10,000 in the department&amp;#39;s jurisdiction&amp;quot;,
       subtitle = str_c(&amp;quot;Cumulative deaths, &amp;quot;, startingYear, &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;, finalYear)) +
  theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;)
  
print(scaledPopsVsDeaths)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/index_files/figure-html/scaled-pop-vs-deaths-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot suggests that Terre Haute is above average but maybe not a huge outlier, even among cities of similar population size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, this plot suggests there is not much of a relationship between city size and number of officer deaths, at least for cities above a certain size. The reason it looks like there is a relationship between population and deaths is almost certainly due to there being greater variability for smaller towns/departments. For example, a single death in a small town would have a big effect on this metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs exclude small towns (population &amp;lt; 50,000) to get a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;scaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = deathCounts_noSmallTowns) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),
             shape = &amp;quot;circle open&amp;quot;,
             alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_point(data = deathCountsHighlights_noSmallTowns,
             mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths),
             shape = &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;,
             color = &amp;quot;coral3&amp;quot;,
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(data = deathCountsWithLabels_noSmallTowns,
                  mapping = aes(x = log10(population), y = deathsPer10k, size = numDeaths,
                                label = locationLabel),
                  size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4,5,6,7),
                     labels = c(&amp;quot;10,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1,000,000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10,000,000&amp;quot;)) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Population&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Deaths per 10K&amp;quot;,
       size = &amp;quot;Total deaths&amp;quot;,
       title = &amp;quot;Officer deaths per 10,000 people in the department&amp;#39;s jurisdiction&amp;quot;,
       subtitle = str_c(&amp;quot;Cumulative deaths, &amp;quot;, startingYear, &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;, finalYear)) +
  theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;)
  
print(scaledPopsVsDeaths_noSmallTowns)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/index_files/figure-html/scaled-pops-vs-deaths-no-small-towns-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot allows us to get a better sense of variability, especially among midsize towns. In this plot, Terre Haute does look a bit more like an outlier. In more quantitative terms, among the locations in the plot above, &lt;strong&gt;Terre Haute is in the 99th percentile for officer deaths&lt;/strong&gt;, scaled by population size. It drops to the 93rd percentile if you include the small towns that were in the previous plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;officer-deaths-over-time&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officer deaths over time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last question I had was whether Terre Haute‚Äôs outlier status was driven by the last 10 years. To get a sense of this, let‚Äôs look at officer deaths over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;deathsOverTime &amp;lt;- ggplot(data = deathCountsByYear) +
  geom_step(mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long),
            alpha = 1/12) +
  geom_step(data = deathCountsByYearHighlights,
            mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long),
            color = &amp;quot;gold2&amp;quot;,
            alpha = 2/3) +
  geom_step(data = filter(deathCountsByYear, location_long == &amp;quot;Terre Haute, IN&amp;quot;),
            mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k),
            color = &amp;quot;coral3&amp;quot;,
            size = 1.5) +
  geom_text_repel(data = filter(deathCountsByYearHighlights, EOW == today()),
                  mapping = aes(x = EOW, y = deathsPer10k, group = location_long,
                                label = location_long),
                  size = 3) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Cumulative officer deaths&amp;quot;,
       subtitle = &amp;quot;Jurisdictions with populations &amp;gt; 50,000&amp;quot;,
       x = &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Total deaths per 10,000 residents&amp;quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
print(deathsOverTime)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/index_files/figure-html/deaths-over-time-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot shows cumulative deaths since 1980 for each department serving an area over 50,000 (again limited to only those departments that had at least one death). Terre Haute is highlighted. It gives the impression that Terre Haute wasn‚Äôt much of an outlier until the past 10 years when the last three officers died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows that no officers died in Terre Haute for several decades before 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion ‚òëÔ∏è&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs fair to say that, right now, Terre Haute stands out statistically. The question is whether that‚Äôs indicative of anything meaningful. With thousands of jurisdictions across the US, some are bound to have unusually high numbers of deaths due to random chance alone. So it‚Äôs hard to draw any broad conclusions from these results without more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, speaking for myself, as someone pretty ignorant of law enforcement, I imagined ‚Äúline of duty‚Äù deaths to be the result of attacks at the hands of suspects. But a number of the deaths in the dataset were caused by things like car crashes, Covid-19 (from the past two years), and heart attacks ‚Äì things that happened while on the job but might be hard to attribute to the job itself. My point isn‚Äôt to diminish any of these deaths at all, only to point out that more deaths isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign of some underlying cause or problem. You would need to look at the causes of death (among other factors) before drawing a conclusion like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code-and-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code and data üìë&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and the full analysis code I used to generate these plots are available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alanjern/police-officer-deaths&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching research methods using formr</title>
      <link>https://alanjern.github.io/post/teaching-research-methods-using-formr/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alanjern.github.io/post/teaching-research-methods-using-formr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-course-&#34;&gt;The course üéí&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s useful to know a bit about my course first to help you decide if the information in this post will be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I teach doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any psych majors and my course doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any psych pre-reqs. It&amp;rsquo;s a small school that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a Qualtrics license. The students are mostly science and engineering majors so they are generally tech-savvy, but they don&amp;rsquo;t all have much programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course itself is focused on replication &amp;ndash; students don&amp;rsquo;t design their own studies &amp;ndash; and I choose which studies they will be replicating. So I have control over the complexity of the study designs they&amp;rsquo;ll be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can see the course syllabus &lt;a href=&#34;https://alanjern.github.io/uploads/syllabi/methods_spring21.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I was looking for was a platform for running online studies that was free, pretty easy to learn, and had enough base functionality to create some simple study designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-formr-&#34;&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;formr&lt;/code&gt;? üõ†Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;formr.png&#34; alt=&#34;formr&#34; title=&#34;formr&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://formr.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;formr&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to alternatives, formr best met all these criteria. Some other options to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qualtrics.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/a&gt;: Most behavioral scientists already know Qualtrics. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and super flexible. But it&amp;rsquo;s not free and I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it where I work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psytoolkit.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PsyToolkit&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve used PsyToolkit in the past. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to learn, even for people with little programming experience. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a better choice over formr if you need to do more cognitive-type experiments where you control what people see on the screen at certain times and collect response time data. But I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the interface and it&amp;rsquo;s more advanced than what I needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jspsych.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;jsPsych&lt;/a&gt;: Another good choice if you want more advanced options. But it would require teaching more programming than my course had time for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-worked-&#34;&gt;What worked üëç&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the somewhat confusing &lt;a href=&#34;https://formr.org/documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, students caught on to the basics of formr pretty quickly. To supplement the official documentation, I made the following tutorial that you are welcome to share&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYESYTRufyE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any specific reports of this, another benefit of formr is that you initially build the experiment in Google Sheets, which was nice when students were working in groups because it was so easy for them to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-didnt-work-&#34;&gt;What didn&amp;rsquo;t work üôÑ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some issues with the &lt;code&gt;formr.org&lt;/code&gt; website itself. I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly grateful to the formr team, but it&amp;rsquo;s a small operation and it&amp;rsquo;s probably not equipped to handle the rising interest formr has received over the past year or so. I believe this was responsible for the two main problems I encountered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make experiments on the &lt;code&gt;formr.org&lt;/code&gt; website, you need an admin account, and new accounts have to be manually approved. After my students signed up, they weren&amp;rsquo;t approved for about 1.5 weeks. In the end, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t catastrophic, but our term is only 10 weeks, and it caused me to have to delay the deadline of the first formr-based assignment. &lt;em&gt;Not ideal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once students were in the thick of collecting data for their final projects, I got multiple reports of the formr site going down. Also &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that the formr team actually recommends installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;your own instance&lt;/a&gt; of formr so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t done this myself so I can&amp;rsquo;t say anything about it. But my plan for the next time I teach this course is to talk to the IT department at my school and see about installing formr on a college server. This should address the sign-up and downtime problems that we suffered this past term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr-&#34;&gt;tl;dr üìî&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;formr is free, requires no set-up (if you run it from the existing website) and can be used to do most of what Qualtrics can do with minimal learning. (It can do a lot more advanced stuff too if you are willing to learn more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great choice for research methods courses that want to offer students a simple solution for building good-looking ‚ú® and functional  ‚öôÔ∏è online studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned after I made this video that the advice I give in it for randomizing subjects equally between conditions is maybe not the optimal method (though it might be the simplest). See &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/g/formr/c/BRRxQi9pFhM/m/Hs2VyKCOAwAJ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
